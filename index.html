            <p>Recently, a huge volume of data referring to human life and surrounding circumstance could be collected and stored 
                by advanced technologies and applications. Whereas, such data become useless to the consumers without any correlative 
                knowledge of data analysis unless presenting them a model which could interact intuitively to reveal the patterns and 
                principles, consequently transforming the sheer amount of data into valuable information.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> As in recent years, ubiquitous computing and communication techniques have promoted the developing tendency of 
            applications within a wide range of territories in terms of transportation, wellbeing and entertainment. This 
            research will present a framework called FuseViz, for the processing of data fusion and visualization on Websites 
            in intelligent environments. In FuseViz-based model, an open-source document-oriented database called Apache CouchDB 
            is used to store the data collected from multiple terminals. Joint data streams are fused by MapReduce, which is a 
            framework for processing parallelizable problems across large datasets. Joint data streams are visualized on scalable 
            vector graphics (SVG), which is an XML-based vector image format with the compatibility of most mainstream web browsers.
        </p>
    
    <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p>There are three requirements of the FuseViz framework for analysis-oriented visualization by the consumers in intelligent 
            environments: accessibility for different devices on Web; modularity and extensibility of data source and visualizations; 
            interactive, embedded, and responsive visualization. There are several front-end languages, including HTML, JavaScript and 
            CSS, they are standards and are supported by a wide range of terminal devices. D3 is a JavaScript library which is used to 
            visualize data following web standards. D3 allows for editing the subset of Document Object Model (DOM) components, in 
            order that only those components are affected when users update their events. Similarly, components could be removed from 
            or added to the visualization of live data streams without rendering other components again. Moreover, the agnostic 
            technique of D3 does not limit visualizations to only one technique (e.g., SVG). Visualization includes not only scalar 
            data, but also incorporates multimedia ones, thus expanding the application of FuseViz to other fields in ubiquitous 
            computing. Eventually, the selection mechanism of D3 significantly simplifies the implementation of zooming, panning, 
            and brush-and-linking, those functions make it easy to transform metadata into a valuable presentation to lay customers. 
            Due to the support of JSON by CouchDB, visualization applications could also be able to embed into other Web pages.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Stimulated by rapidly expanding datasets from sensors, simulations, and other digital sources, visualization is gaining 
            interest to leverage powerful computation resources to drive engineers and scientists to make sense of the massive 
            datasets. This research presents an unprecedented framework named FuseViz, for implementing data fusion and visualization 
            applications in smart environments, which is presented on the Web platform. The FuseViz could help people to save energy 
            and cost. For instance, people could be shown how to optimize their behaviour to save household consumption by using 
            visualization application. There are still many problems that affect the performance of visualization, such as bandwidth 
            and network latency. These will be the subsequent subject of future research.
