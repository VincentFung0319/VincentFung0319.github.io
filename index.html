            <p>Recently, a huge volume of data referring to human life and surrounding circumstance could be collected and 
            stored by advanced technologies and applications. However, such data become useless to lay users without any 
            background in data analysis if they are not presented in a model which implements intuitive interaction to 
            reveal the patterns and principles, thus transforming the sheer amount of data into valuable information.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In recent years, ubiquitous computing and communication techniques have promoted the development of applications 
            across a wide range of domains in terms of transportation, wellbeing and entertainment. This research will present 
            FuseViz, a framework for the processing of Web-based data fusion and visualization in smart environments. In FuseViz-based 
            model, an open-source document-oriented database called Apache CouchDB is used to store the data collected from multiple 
            sources. Joint data streams are fused by MapReduce, which is a framework for processing parallelizable problems across large 
            datasets. Joint data streams are visualized on scalable vector graphics (SVG), which is an XML-based vector image format supported 
            by major modern web browsers.
        </p>
    
    <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p>There are three requirements of the FuseViz framework for analysis-oriented visualization by lay users in smart environments: support 
            for different devices’ Web access; modular and extensible data source and visualizations; interactive, embedded, and responsive 
            visualization. There are several front-end languages, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, they are standards and are available on a 
            wide array of devices. D3 is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 allows for editing the subset of 
            Document Object Model (DOM) elements, so that only those elements are affected when user-generated events are updated. Similarly, 
            elements could be removed from or added to the visualization of live data streams without rendering other elements again. Moreover, 
            the agnostic technique of D3 does not limit visualizations to one technology (e.g., SVG). Visualization includes not only scalar data, 
            but also incorporates multimedia ones, thus expanding the applicability of FuseViz to other fields in ubiquitous computing. Finally, 
            the selection mechanism of D3 greatly simplifies the implementation of zooming, panning, and brush-and-linking, those functions make 
            it easy to transform raw data into valuable information to lay users. Due to the support of JSON by CouchDB, visualization applications 
            could also be embedded in other Web pages.
        </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Stimulated by rapidly expanding datasets from sensors, simulations, and other digital sources, visualization is gaining interest to leverage 
            powerful computation resources to drive engineers and scientists to make sense of the massive datasets. This research presents a novel 
            framework called FuseViz, for the implementation of Web-based data fusion and visualization applications in smart environments. The FuseViz 
            could help people to save energy and cost. For instance, people could be shown how to change their behaviour to improve home energy efficiency 
            by using visualization application for smart home. There are still many problems that affect the performance of visualization, such as bandwidth 
            and network latency. These will be the subsequent subject of future’s research.
